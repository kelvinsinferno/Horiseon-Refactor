https://github.com/kelvinsinferno/Horiseon-Refactor

The Horieson website focuses on SEO, Online Reputation Management, and Social Media Marketing.
We were asked to refactor the code so that it met accessibility standards. 

I have:
- Adjusted the semantics and structure so that it is more easy to navigate.
- added Alt attributes for broader accessibility.
- cleaned up the title element
- cleaned up the css cobining repeated tags
- reordered the css structure
